          <p><b>Sometimes, simple font pairings are the ones that make the most impact—as is the case with Raleway and Open Sans.</b></p>
          <p>Raleway is a sans serif font designed specifically for larger text (like headings). When paired with Open Sans, another sans serif with a friendly, approachable design that’s optimized for a variety of uses and sizes (including web, print, and body text), the final look is simple, straightforward, and elegant—making it a solid choice for everything from corporate marketing materials to more creative designs (like flyers or posters).</p>

          <p><b>A good combination of modern sans-serif typefaces</b></p>
          <p>Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts.</p>
          <p>Cabin is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric Gill's typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans. It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality.</p>

          <p><b>A good combination of modern sans-serif typefaces</b></p>
          <p>Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold Italic. It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. The flavour of the font is rather mixed. It's monolinear-ish, but has a tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac OS X.)</p>
          <p>Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.
